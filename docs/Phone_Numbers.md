# Phone Numbers

## Status Quo Usage of Phone Numbers

Most people use a single phone number for everything and signing up for all online services. This widespread usage makes phone numbers a de facto identity marker in the digital world.

## What Is Wrong With It?

- **Privacy Risk**: Phone numbers are easily linked to personal identities, making them a weak point for privacy-focused individuals.
- **Data Breaches**: Many organizations store phone numbers insecurely, leading to frequent leaks and exposure in breaches.
- **SIM Swapping**: Attackers can hijack phone numbers by convincing carriers to transfer control, leading to account takeovers.
- **Spam & Tracking**: Phone numbers are often sold to advertisers, resulting in spam calls, texts, and tracking across services.
- **Mandatory for Services**: Many platforms require a phone number, limiting anonymity and increasing dependency on telecom providers.

## Usage Strategy
- **Separate Numbers for Different Purposes**: Ideally, maintain 2-3 separate numbers—one for trusted contacts, one for essential accounts that don’t require immediate attention, and one absolutely disposable number for unimportant platforms that demand a phone number.
- **Avoid Using a Personal Number for MFA**: Opt for app-based authenticators like Aegis or hardware keys instead of SMS.
- **Use VoIP or Alias Numbers**: For sign-ups and less critical accounts, use a secondary VoIP or alias number.
- **Consider a Privacy-Focused Carrier**: If you must use a SIM, prefer services that do not require ID verification and support eSIM activation.
- **Monitor for Leaks**: Regularly check if your number appears in data breaches using services like [Trend Micro's ID Protection](https://idprotect.trendmicro.com/), [Cybernews Personal Data Leak Checker](https://cybernews.com/personal-data-leak-check/), and [IDStrong's Phone Number Exposure Scan](https://www.idstrong.com/) for exposure risks.

By taking these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with traditional phone numbers while maintaining necessary functionality.
