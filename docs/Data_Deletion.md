# Data Deletion

### Introduction
The internet often retains personal data without your consent, posing privacy and security risks such as identity theft. Services like [**DeleteMe**](https://joindeleteme.com), [**Incognito**](https://www.incognito.com/), and others leverage advancements in **law-tech**—a fusion of legal frameworks and technology—to help remove your data from online sources, including:

- **Data broker websites** (e.g., Spokeo, Whitepages).  
- **Search engine results** (e.g., Google, Bing).  
- **Public databases** (e.g., voter or property records).

By utilizing laws like [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa), these services streamline legal processes to enforce your privacy rights.
