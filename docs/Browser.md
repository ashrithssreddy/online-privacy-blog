## The Status Quo and the Problem

The modern internet relies heavily on data collection, often at the expense of user privacy. Most mainstream browsers, such as Google Chrome and Safari, are designed to optimize user experience and provide fast, feature-rich browsing. However, they also enable extensive tracking, profiling, and data harvesting. This is achieved through cookies, fingerprinting, and third-party scripts embedded in websites. Despite their sleek interfaces and integration with ecosystems, these browsers contribute to a broader surveillance-based business model.

### Key Issues:

- **Browser Fingerprinting**: Browsers collect unique configurations of your device, such as screen resolution, fonts, plugins, and hardware details. This allows websites to uniquely identify and track you without cookies.
- **Excessive Data Sharing**: Browsers often share user data with parent companies and advertising networks, contributing to invasive tracking.
- **Default Settings Favoring Trackers**: Mainstream browsers tend to enable tracking by default, requiring users to manually disable settings or install privacy extensions.

For instance, visiting a website may expose sensitive data about your system, such as IP address, location, device type, and installed software, all of which can be used to build a digital profile.

## Alternatives and Why They Are Better

Several privacy-focused browsers offer better protection against tracking and data collection. These browsers prioritize user privacy by design and often include advanced anti-tracking measures.
