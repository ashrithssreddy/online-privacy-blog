# Pseudonymous Accounts

## Introduction
Pseudonymous accounts enable users to interact online without revealing their real identity. Whether for privacy, security, or anonymity, these accounts protect your personal data while still allowing you to participate in online platforms.

- Use a dedicated pseudonymous email address to sign up for accounts.
- Recommended privacy-focused email providers:
  - [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/)

### 2. **Email Forwarding, Relay, and Aliasing**
Email forwarding and aliasing provide an additional layer of privacy by masking your real email address.

   - Supports custom domains for advanced users.

2. **[Mozilla Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/)**

   - Ideal for one-time or recurring use without revealing your primary address.

### 3. **Username Selection**
- Avoid using usernames tied to your real identity.
- Tips for creating pseudonyms:

## Operating Pseudonymous Accounts

### 1. **Separate Browsing Environment**
- Use a dedicated browser or container for pseudonymous activities.
- Recommended tools:
  - **Firefox Multi-Account Containers** to isolate accounts.
  - Privacy-focused browsers like **Tor** or **LibreWolf**.

---

### 2. **Device and Network Isolation**
- Keep pseudonymous accounts on separate devices or virtual machines.
- Use VPNs or Tor to anonymize your IP address:
  - Choose no-log VPNs like **Mullvad** or **Proton VPN**.
  - For high-risk environments, use multi-hop VPNs or Tor bridges.

---

### 3. **Prevent Data Linkage**
- Avoid sharing real-world information (e.g., name, location, habits).
- Be consistent: do not cross-link pseudonymous and real-world accounts.
- Randomize behaviors to prevent activity patterns from being traced back to you.

## Advanced Tactics for Pseudonymity

### 1. **Compartmentalization**
- Maintain separate pseudonyms for different activities (e.g., social media, forums, financial services).
- Use unique email addresses and usernames for each pseudonym.

### 2. **Self-Hosting Services**
- For enhanced privacy, self-host essential services under a pseudonym:
  - Email servers (e.g., Postfix/Dovecot with hardened configurations).
  - Encrypted file-sharing servers.

### 3. **Disposable Accounts**
- Use disposable accounts for one-time interactions or temporary sign-ups.
- Recommended disposable email providers:
  1. **[Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/)**  
     - Provides a temporary email address that expires after a short period.  
     - No sign-up required and offers immediate use.

  2. **[Temp Mail](https://temp-mail.org/)**  
     - Generates instant disposable email addresses for temporary use.  
     - Emails are automatically deleted after a short retention period.

  3. **[10 Minute Mail](https://10minutemail.com/)**

## Red Flags and Risks
- **Behavioral Profiling:** Repeated behaviors (e.g., login times, writing style) can compromise pseudonymity.
- **Data Requests:** Some platforms may demand government ID or additional information.
- **Browser Fingerprinting:** Mitigate by using hardened browsers or spoofing extensions.

## Conclusion
Creating and maintaining pseudonymous accounts requires careful separation of identity, tools, and behaviors. With a combination of privacy-focused tools, strong operational security (OpSec), and advanced tactics like compartmentalization, users can minimize the risk of identity linkage while maintaining a functional online presence.
