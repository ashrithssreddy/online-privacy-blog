# Privacy-Focused Messaging Apps

## Introduction
Mainstream messaging apps often collect user data, analyze metadata, and store conversations on centralized servers. Privacy-focused messaging apps prioritize end-to-end encryption (E2EE), minimal data collection, and user control over data.

## What's Wrong with Status Quo Messaging Apps?

### **1. WhatsApp**
- **Metadata Collection**: Collects details like whom you contact, when, and how often.
- **Cloud Backups**: Backups stored on Google Drive or iCloud are not end-to-end encrypted.
- **Owned by Meta**: Shares some data with Meta's ecosystem for business and advertising purposes.

### **2. Facebook Messenger**
- **Lacks Default Encryption**: Messages are not end-to-end encrypted unless using the "Secret Conversations" feature.
- **Data Integration**: Heavily integrates with Facebook for targeting and tracking.

### **3. Telegram**
- **No Default E2EE**: Group chats and most direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted.
- **Centralized Storage**: Messages are stored on Telegramâ€™s servers, increasing potential exposure to breaches.

### **4. iMessage**
- **Limited Encryption Scope**: Backups stored in iCloud are not encrypted.
- **Data Retention**: Apple retains metadata such as timestamps, recipient details, and IP addresses.

## Enhancements to Messaging Privacy

### Beginner Enhancements:
1. **Enable Disappearing Messages**  
   - Many apps like Signal, Session, and Telegram offer disappearing messages to automatically delete sensitive conversations.
   
2. **Disable Cloud Backups**  
   - Avoid unencrypted backups on cloud services (e.g., iCloud, Google Drive).

---

### Intermediate Enhancements:
1. **Use Pseudonymous Sign-Up**  
   - Register with a secondary email or a temporary phone number for apps that require identifiers.
   
2. **Leverage Decentralized Solutions**  
   - Use apps like Matrix with self-hosted servers for complete control over your communication data.

---

### Advanced Enhancements:
1. **Network Privacy**  
   - Use a VPN to anonymize your internet traffic while using messaging apps.
   
2. **Dedicated Messaging Devices**  
   - Use a separate device for secure communication, paired with a privacy-focused OS like GrapheneOS.
